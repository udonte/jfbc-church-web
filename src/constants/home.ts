  confession:
    "2025 is our year of divine presence. September is our month of the harvest of miracles. Jesus is the miracle worker. He is my lord and savior. I am a miracle child. His saving power works in me. He said I will do the same works that he did and even greater. I believe his word. Jesus is still the same. I declare I am a vessel for signs and wonder. Mighty signs accompany me. The power of God is working in my life I have all needs met.  I am blessed, lifted and favoured. I will be a blessing to everyone I meet. This month - miracles, miracles and miracles occur daily in my life in Jesus name. I ill be a good member of our church, serving him with all my strength and manifesting His glory.",
